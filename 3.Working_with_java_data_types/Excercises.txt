1. 	Define a reference type named Bird. Define an instance method named fly in Bird.
	Define a few instance as well as static variables of type int, float, double, boolean and String in Bird.

2. 	Create a TestClass that has a static variable of type Bird. Initialize this variable with a valid Bird object.
	Print out the default values of static and instance variables of Bird fromthe main method ofTestClass. 
	Also print out the static variable of TestClass from main. Observe the output

	// vragen:	1. static field public/private? instance fields are often private.
			2. why im getting void is not allowed here?
